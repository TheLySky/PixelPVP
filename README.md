### ✨ The Competitive Edge

PixelPVP strips away distractions to focus entirely on what matters: winning your next fight.

### ⚡️ Maximum FPS

True to its 16x16 roots, this pack is lightweight and built for speed. Experience buttery-smooth gameplay and maximum frames, even on low-end setups.

### 🔥 Low Fire

Never lose sight of your target again. The fire animation has been drastically lowered to ensure your vision remains clear during intense close-combat encounters.

### 🗡️ Unique Compact Swords

Not just another "short sword" pack. We’ve introduced **custom, compact sword models** that provide a superior field of view while maintaining a distinct, high-quality look - giving you more visibility without sacrificing style.

### ⚫️ Sleek Dark Mode

The minimalist dark theme reduces eye strain, eliminates distractions, and makes your hotbar and UI elements pop.

### 📦 Transparent UI

Stay aware of your surroundings even while looting. The GUI and inventory feature a semi-transparent design, so you’re never caught off guard.

### 🛡️ Enhanced Gear

Every weapon and armor piece has been refined for instant recognition, ensuring you can read your opponent's gear at a single glance.
